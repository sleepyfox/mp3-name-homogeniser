This is a simple little utility to make the filenames of mp3 files into a consistant format, as the publisher will adopt their own naming convention e.g.

<artist> <album> <track number> <track name>.<extension>
<artist>-<track number>-<track name>.<extension>
<artist> <album> <track number>-<track name>.<extension>
...

This plays merry hell with my Android music player app, so in order to learn a little about both node.js and Javascript I thought it might be a nice idea to do this as a node.js script. 

Warning: smelly code, work in progress and noobish mistakes probably all present. Do not use unless you have backed up your files first blah blah. 

There's a test script called 'test-setup.sh' that will create a folder and some fake mp3 files, a test runner script 'test-run.sh' that calls mp3rename.js with appropriate arguments, and a test cleanup script 'test-cleanup.sh' that removes the test mp3 directory and all of its contents. All scripts expect to be run from the same directory.
